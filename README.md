# CalendarPlus

CalendarPlus is a mobile calendar application that enables users to enter workload associated with an event when they add one. Prior to adding an event, people can estimate the realistic amount of time that event will require in their new schedule. The application makes use of an open source calendar project called [TimesSquare](https://github.com/square/objc-TimesSquare/)
